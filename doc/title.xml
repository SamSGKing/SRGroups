  <Abstract>
    
     <Package>SRGroups</Package> is a package for searching up self-replicating groups of regular rooted trees and performing computations on these groups. This package allows the user to generate more self-replicating groups at greater depths with its in-built functions, and is an extension of the <Package>transgrp</Package> package.
