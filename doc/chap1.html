<h3>1 <span class="Heading">Introduction</span></h3>

<p>Let <span class="Math">G</span> be a subgroup of the regular rooted k-tree, <span class="Math">\textrm{Aut}(T_{k})</span> with its group action, <span class="Math">\alpha</span>, defined as <span class="Math">\alpha(g,x)=g(x)</span>, where <span class="Math">g\in G</span> are the automorphisms of <span class="Math">G</span> and <span class="Math">x\in X</span> the vertices of <span class="Math">T_{k}</span>. Let <span class="Math">\textrm{stab}_{G}(0)=\{g\in G : \alpha(g,0) = 0\}</span>, and <span class="Math">T_0\subset T_{k}</span> be the set of all vertices below and including the vertex 0. Additonally, let <span class="Math">\varphi_0 : \textrm{stab}_G(0)\rightarrow G</span> be a group homomorphism with the mapping <span class="Math">g\mapsto g|_{T_0}</span>. Then <span class="Math">G</span> is called self-replicating if and only if the following two conditions, <span class="Math">\mathcal{R}_k</span>, are satisfied: <span class="Math">G</span> is vertex transitive on level 1 of <span class="Math">T_{k}</span>, and <span class="Math">\varphi_0\left(\textrm{stab}_{G}(0)\right)=G</span>.</p>

<p>A group <span class="Math">G\leq\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k})</span> acting greater than level 1 is said to have sufficient rigid automorphisms if for each pair of vertices <span class="Math">u</span> and <span class="Math">v</span> on level <span class="Math">1</span> of the tree, <span class="Math">T_{k,1}</span>, there exists an automorphism <span class="Math">g\in G</span> such that <span class="Math">g(u)=v</span> and <span class="Math">g|_u=e</span>, where <span class="Math">g</span> is called <span class="Math">(u,v)</span>-rigid. For a self-replicating group <span class="Math">G</span> on level <span class="Math">n</span> of the tree, <span class="Math">T_{k,n}</span>, with sufficient rigid automorphisms, the maximal extension of <span class="Math">G</span>, <span class="Math">\mathcal{M}(G)</span>, is the largest self-replicating group (not necessarily with sufficient rigid automorphisms) on <span class="Math">\textrm{Aut}(T_{k,n+1})</span> that projects onto <span class="Math">G</span>, defined as:</p>

<p class="pcenter">\mathcal{M}(G):= \{x\in\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k,n+1}) : \varphi_{n+1}(x)\in G and x|_v\in G \textrm{for all v on level 1}\}.</p>

<p>The self-replicating property is preserved across conjugacy. For a group <span class="Math">H\leq\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k,n})</span> with sufficient rigid automorphisms, and a self-replicating group <span class="Math">G\leq\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k,n+1})</span>, there exists a conjugate of <span class="Math">G</span> in <span class="Math">\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k,n+1})</span> with sufficient rigid automorphisms. Since groups on level 1 inherently have sufficient rigid automorphisms, then self-replicating groups with sufficient rigid automorphisms can be found on all levels of the tree.</p>

<p>The <strong class="pkg">SRGroups</strong> package serves to provide a library of these self-replicating groups to further the ongoing studies of infinite networks and group theory. By using the above definitions and conditions, several GAP methods and functions have been built to allow computations of these groups and expand the understanding of their behaviour.</p>

<p>First, this package acts as a library for searching currently known self-replicating groups for varying degrees and levels of regular rooted trees. This package also acts as a regular GAP package with functions that allow the expansion of the library and addition of attributes/properties relevant to self-replicating groups. Additional functions also exist in this package that are compatible with GraphViz, to plot diagrams of the extension behaviour of these self-replicating groups and their corresponding Hasse diagrams at different depths.</p>
