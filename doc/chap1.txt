  [33X[0;0YLet  [23XG[123X  be a subgroup of the regular rooted k-tree, [23X\textrm{Aut}(T_{k})[123X with
  its  group action, [23X\alpha[123X, defined as [23X\alpha(g,x)=g(x)[123X, where [23Xg\in G[123X are the
  automorphisms   of   [23XG[123X   and   [23Xx\in   X[123X   the   vertices   of   [23XT_{k}[123X.   Let
  [23X\textrm{stab}_{G}(0)=\{g\in  G  : \alpha(g,0) = 0\}[123X, and [23XT_0\subset T_{k}[123X be
  the  set  of all vertices below and including the vertex 0. Additonally, let
  [23X\varphi_0 : \textrm{stab}_G(0)\rightarrow G[123X be a group homomorphism with the
  mapping  [23Xg\mapsto g|_{T_0}[123X. Then [23XG[123X is called self-replicating if and only if
  the  following  two  conditions,  [23X\mathcal{R}_k[123X,  are satisfied: [23XG[123X is vertex
  transitive        on        level        1        of        [23XT_{k}[123X,       and
  [23X\varphi_0\left(\textrm{stab}_{G}(0)\right)=G[123X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA group [23XG\leq\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k})[123X acting greater than level 1 is said to have
  sufficient rigid automorphisms if for each pair of vertices [23Xu[123X and [23Xv[123X on level
  [23X1[123X of the tree, [23XT_{k,1}[123X, there exists an automorphism [23Xg\in G[123X such that [23Xg(u)=v[123X
  and [23Xg|_u=e[123X, where [23Xg[123X is called [23X(u,v)[123X-rigid. For a self-replicating group [23XG[123X on
  level  [23Xn[123X  of  the  tree,  [23XT_{k,n}[123X,  with sufficient rigid automorphisms, the
  maximal  extension  of  [23XG[123X,  [23X\mathcal{M}(G)[123X,  is the largest self-replicating
  group   (not   necessarily   with   sufficient   rigid   automorphisms)   on
  [23X\textrm{Aut}(T_{k,n+1})[123X that projects onto [23XG[123X, defined as:[133X
  
  
  [24X[33X[0;6Y\mathcal{M}(G):=  \{x\in\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k,n+1})  : \varphi_{n+1}(x)\in G and
  x|_v\in G \textrm{for all v on level 1}\}.[133X
  
  [124X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  self-replicating  property  is  preserved across conjugacy. For a group
  [23XH\leq\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k,n})[123X   with  sufficient  rigid  automorphisms,  and  a
  self-replicating   group   [23XG\leq\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k,n+1})[123X,   there   exists  a
  conjugate   of   [23XG[123X   in   [23X\mathrm{Aut}(T_{k,n+1})[123X   with   sufficient  rigid
  automorphisms.  Since  groups  on  level  1 inherently have sufficient rigid
  automorphisms,   then   self-replicating   groups   with   sufficient  rigid
  automorphisms can be found on all levels of the tree.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XSRGroups[105X  package serves to provide a library of these self-replicating
  groups to further the ongoing studies of infinite networks and group theory.
  By  using  the  above  definitions  and  conditions, several GAP methods and
  functions  have  been built to allow computations of these groups and expand
  the understanding of their behaviour.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFirst,  this  package  acts  as  a  library  for  searching  currently known
  self-replicating  groups  for  varying  degrees and levels of regular rooted
  trees.  This  package also acts as a regular GAP package with functions that
  allow  the  expansion  of  the library and addition of attributes/properties
  relevant to self-replicating groups. Additional functions also exist in this
  package that are compatible with GraphViz, to plot diagrams of the extension
  behaviour  of  these  self-replicating  groups and their corresponding Hasse
  diagrams at different depths.[133X
